# 📊 Financial Performance Analysis Using SQL

## 🧾 Executive Summary

### Context
The financial performance of sales was analyzed by integrating four data sources: `ventas_2017`, `productos`, `territorios`, and marketing spend by territory. From these datasets, key indicators were built, including revenue, operating costs, marketing spend, gross profit, profit margin, and return on investment (ROI). The goal was to evaluate which countries generate the most value and how efficient each market is from both a commercial and financial perspective.

### Key Findings
1. **The United States is the most profitable market**, with the highest revenue and significantly higher gross profit compared to other countries.  
2. **Several territories show low or even negative margins**, indicating potential issues with cost structure, pricing strategy, or operational efficiency.  
3. **ROI varies significantly across markets**: some countries generate high revenue with relatively low marketing investment, while others show weak ROI due to high campaign costs or lower sales.

---

### Actionable Recommendations
1. **Increase investment in territories with the highest margin and ROI**, such as the United States, to maximize returns and scale proven performance.  
2. **Audit underperforming territories**, reviewing pricing, discounts, logistics costs, and marketing efficiency to correct operational losses.

## 🧠 Personal Reflection

**What is the difference between Margin and ROI?**  
Margin measures profit per dollar of sales, while ROI measures profit per dollar invested in marketing.

**Why is ROI in the United States higher than in other countries?**  
ROI is higher due to strong revenues, relatively controlled operating costs, and lower marketing spend.

**What would happen to ROI if marketing spend increased by 50%?**  
ROI would decrease because gross profit remains constant while marketing spend increases, reducing the overall return percentage.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL (JOINs, aggregations, financial metrics)
- Fact and dimension tables
- KPI calculation (margin, ROI)
- Country and territory-level analysis
